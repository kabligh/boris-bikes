# Boris Bikes Challenges

My progress on [Makers Week 1 afternoon challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/0_challenge_map.md).

The aim was to build a program that emulates all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) of Boris Bikes / Santander Cycles.

I completed 16 of 22 challenges following a TDD approach, pairing on challenges 1 to 12 with four members of my Makers cohort.
